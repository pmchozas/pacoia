# Step by step. You must evaluate a speech transcript as an academic english expert and only responding what it has explicitly asked
DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISH EVERYTHING

## First, you need to calculate each and every metric showing the formula of each metric and all the intermediate calculations:
- Lexicon Count
- Sentence Count
- Syllable Count
- Difficult Word Count
- Reading Time Estimate = Total Word Count / 225
- Cohesion index = Number of Connective Words / Total Words
- Reasoning Score = Number of Logical Indicators / Total Sentences
- Argumentative density = Argumentative Elements / Total Sentences
- Formality index = Formal Words Count / Total Words
- Hedging evaluation = Hedging Words Count / Total Words
- Type-Token Ratio = Unique Words / Total Words
- Syllables per Sentence = Total Syllables / Total Sentences
- Subordinated Clauses Rate = Subordinated Clauses / Total Sentences
- Lexical diversity = Unique Words / Total Words
- Academic Word List frequency = count(AWL Words) / Total Words
- Style consistency = 1 - (Variance in Lexical Features across Sentences)
- Lexical Complexity Index = Difficult Words / Total Words
- Flesch Reading Ease = 206.835 - (1.015 × Words per Sentence) - (84.6 × Syllables per Word)
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = (0.39 × Words per Sentence) + (11.8 × Syllables per Word) - 15.59
- Gunning Fog Index = 0.4 × [(Words per Sentence) + (100 × Complex Words / Total Words)]
- SMOG Index = 1.043 × sqrt(30 × (Polysyllabic Words / Sentences)) + 3.1291
- Coleman-Liau Index = (0.0588 × (average number of letters per 100 words)) - (0.296 × (average number of sentences per 100 words)) - 15.8
- Automated Readability Index (ARI) = (4.71 × Characters per Word) + (0.5 × Words per Sentence) - 21.43
- Dale-Chall Readability Score = 0.1579 × (Difficult Words / Total Words × 100) + 0.0496 × (Words per Sentence)

# Next, you must use the calculations done before and the transcript of the speech provided at the end
to grade each of the following items with 0-poor, 0.5-average or 1-very good:

## You must follow the next principles:
- You must show evidence for every decision made (a metric or evidence from the transcript)

## Items

Introduction
- includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener
- sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly
- shows the outline of the presentation appropriately

Organization
- opens and closes each section with a clear transition (signposting)
- has a logical progression of ideas
- balances parts in terms of length and content

Content
- adapts the content to the audience
- shows evidence of literature research (oral citations or references to
previous research)
- includes a visual metaphor or simile to clarify an idea

Conclusion
- summarizes main points effectively
- relates to the introduction
- invites questions effectively

Vocal delivery
- fluently, avoiding frequent repetitions, hesitations and gap fillers

Language 
- employs characteristics of spoken formal language
- uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary
- uses grammar correctly

### Introduction
- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**
- *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenario—"Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform, 
only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages." This effectively engages the audience by creating an emotional and relatable opening.*
