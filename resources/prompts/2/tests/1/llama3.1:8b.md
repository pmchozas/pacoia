**Signposting**: *expressions like "One way to address hate speech...", "Another approach is..."* are used to transition between ideas and sections.
**Fillers**: The expression "uh" in the last sentence indicates a filler that can be avoided for better vocal delivery.
**Informal**: Expressions like "millions worldwide", "so yeah" are informal and not suitable for formal speech.
**Exaggerations**: There is no clear exaggeration in this transcript, but some statements could be considered as overstating the importance or prevalence of a topic ("unfortunate reality", 
"important topic").
**Contractions**: No contractions are used in this transcript.
**Subjective**: Expressions like "I will explore effective strategies" and "tackling hate speech requires multiple solutions" are subjective and not supported by clear evidence.
**Vague**: The statement "multiple solutions" is vague and could be clarified with specific examples.
