### Introduction

- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**
  - *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenarioâ€”"Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform, only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages." This effectively engages 
the audience by creating an emotional and relatable opening.*

- **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker introduces the topic with "This is the unfortunate reality for millions worldwide. Today, I will explore effective strategies to combat hate speech on social 
media." However, the introduction could be more concise and direct.*

- **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker mentions that they will cover content moderation and digital literacy education as key approaches. This provides a clear structure but could benefit from being 
more explicit in stating it.*

### Organization

- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speech starts smoothly, but the closing of sections is somewhat abrupt, without clear signposting phrases like "In summary" or "To conclude."*

- **Has a logical progression of ideas (1)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker logically moves from defining hate speech to discussing strategies and concluding with the importance. This is well-structured.*

- **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The introduction is strong, but the body seems unevenly divided, with more focus on one strategy than another. Additionally, there's a filler word "uh" which breaks the flow.*

### Content

- **Adapts the content to the audience (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The content is generally appropriate for a formal setting but could be more engaging by addressing common misconceptions or providing real-life examples.*

- **Shows evidence of literature research (0)**
  - *Evidence: There are no citations, references, or additional sources mentioned to support the claims.*

- **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (0)**
  - *Evidence: The speech does not include any metaphors or similes to clarify ideas.*

### Conclusion

- **Summarizes main points effectively (1)**
  - *Evidence: "To conclude, tackling hate speech requires multiple solutions..." is a strong concluding sentence that summarizes the key strategies discussed.*

- **Relates to the introduction (1)**
  - *Evidence: The conclusion reinforces the opening scenario and reiterates the importance of addressing hate speech on social media. This ties back well to the introduction.*

- **Invites questions effectively (1)**
  - *Evidence: "Any questions?" is a clear invitation for audience interaction, though it could be more engaging by specifying how they can contribute or ask follow-up questions.*

### Vocal Delivery

- **Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker uses filler words like "uh" which breaks the flow of speech. Additionally, there are some pauses that could be reduced for better fluency.*

### Language

- **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The language is generally formal but could benefit from more precise and varied vocabulary to avoid repetition.*

- **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (1)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker uses appropriate terminology such as "hate speech" and mentions specific strategies like content moderation and digital literacy. However, the overall range of 
vocabulary can be improved.*

- **Uses grammar correctly (0)**
  - *Evidence: There are grammatical errors in the sentence structure ("Today, I will explore effective strategies to combat hate speech on social media"), which detracts from clarity.* 

### Summary

Overall, the speaker has a good grasp of the topic and presents it effectively with some clear strengths. However, there is room for improvement in organization, content depth, fluency, and 
grammar. The introduction and conclusion are strong, but the body could benefit from clearer transitions and more detailed evidence to support the claims.
