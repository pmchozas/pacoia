### Grade Evidence

#### Introduction
- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenarioâ€”"Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform, only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages." This effectively engages 
the audience by creating an emotional and relatable opening.*
- **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (1)**
  - *Evidence: The introduction clearly states that "hate speech on social media has the power to destroy reputations, harm mental health, and fuel violence," which sets a clear theme for 
the presentation.*
- **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: While the speaker mentions that they will discuss three main points (legal landscape, role of tech companies, practical steps), there is no clear outline or summary of these 
points.*

#### Organization
- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (0)**
  - *Evidence: The speech lacks clear transitions between sections. For example, the shift from discussing legal landscapes to the role of tech companies is abrupt.*
- **Has a logical progression of ideas (0)**
  - *Evidence: The ideas are not logically structured. There is an unnecessary mention of "stuff" and "um," which disrupts the flow.*
- **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0)**
  - *Evidence: The speech is unevenly balanced, with some sections being more detailed than others due to filler words like "like" and "um."*

#### Content
- **Adapts the content to the audience (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The use of filler words and informal language ("stuff," "right?") suggests a lack of adaptation to a formal audience.*
- **Shows evidence of literature research (0)**
  - *Evidence: There are no references or citations to previous research, which is crucial for academic presentations.*
- **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (0)**
  - *Evidence: The speech does not include any visual metaphors or similes.*

#### Conclusion
- **Summarizes main points effectively (1)**
  - *Evidence: The conclusion restates the key points, providing a clear summary of the discussion.*
- **Relates to the introduction (1)**
  - *Evidence: The conclusion ties back to the initial scenario, reinforcing the main theme.*
- **Invites questions effectively (1)**
  - *Evidence: The speech ends with an open invitation for questions, encouraging audience engagement.*

#### Vocal Delivery
- **Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: There are numerous filler words ("um," "like"), which detract from fluency.*
  
#### Language
- **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0)**
  - *Evidence: The speech uses informal language and filler words, failing to employ the characteristics of spoken formal language.*
- **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (0)**
  - *Evidence: The vocabulary is limited and repetitive due to the use of filler words.*
- **Uses grammar correctly (0)**
  - *Evidence: There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as "we have laws, and stuff."*

### Signposting
**Signposting**: 
- *Expressions*: "Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform," "For the first part," "Moving on to the role of tech companies," "In conclusion."
- *Evidence: The speech could benefit from more structured signposts to guide the audience through the presentation.

### Conclusion
The overall performance in this evaluation is quite poor due to the lack of formal language, clear organization, and effective use of filler words. Improvements can be made by reducing 
informal language, enhancing fluency, and structuring content more logically. 

### Recommendations:
- **Reduce Informal Language**: Minimize the use of "like," "stuff," and other filler words.
- **Enhance Fluency**: Practice to improve verbal flow and clarity.
- **Improve Organization**: Develop a clear structure for each section with logical transitions.
- **Include Citations**: Incorporate references or citations from research to support your points. 

These changes will significantly improve the quality of the presentation.
