   ### Evaluation Results Explanation

   - **Introduction**: Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (starts with an engaging and thought-provoking statement). Sets the theme or introduces the topic 
clearly (clearly states that the speech will discuss hate speech on social media and its effects, as well as proposed solutions). Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (gives a 
brief introduction of the three main points to be discussed in the presentation).
   - **Organization**: Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (uses signposting phrases like "Then," "Lastly," and "So"). Has a logical progression of ideas (discusses legal 
landscape, role of tech companies, and individual actions in a coherent order). Balances parts in terms of length and content (the three main sections are roughly equal in length and 
content).
   - **Content**: Adapts the content to the audience (the topic is relevant and important for social media users). Shows evidence of literature research (there are no explicit oral citations 
or references to previous research, but the speaker mentions that laws and company policies exist regarding hate speech on social media). Includes a visual metaphor or simile (none found in 
this transcript).
   - **Conclusion**: Summarizes main points effectively (restates the three main points of the presentation). Relates to the introduction (links the conclusion back to the opening statement 
about the importance of taking responsibility for making social media a safer place). Invites questions effectively (asks an open-ended question that encourages further discussion).
   - **Vocal Delivery**: Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (the speaker shows some hesitation and uses filler words like "um" and "like," but overall delivers the presentation with 
relatively good fluency).
   - **Language**: Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (uses a conversational tone while maintaining a formal and clear delivery). Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary 
(uses appropriate and relevant terms related to hate speech, social media, and regulations). Uses grammar correctly (no grammatical errors were found in this transcript).
