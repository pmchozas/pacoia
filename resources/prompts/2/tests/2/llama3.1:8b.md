## Evidence for evaluation

### Introduction
- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (0)**: The speech starts with a simple statement "Okay, so today, I want to talk about hate speech" without creating an 
emotional and relatable opening.

### Organization
- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (0)**: The speaker jumps between ideas without providing clear signposting, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of 
ideas. For example, after discussing the impact of hate speech on mental health, the speaker suddenly shifts to how social media platforms are addressing it.

### Content
- **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (0)**: The speaker mentions "a garden" as an analogy for social media but doesn't explain its relevance to the topic of hate speech.

### Conclusion
- **Summarizes main points effectively (0.5)**: The conclusion fails to summarize the key ideas presented in the speech, leaving the audience with a sense of uncertainty about what was 
discussed.

### Vocal Delivery
- **Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (0)**: The speaker uses several fillers such as "um" and "yeah," which disrupts the flow of the presentation.

### Language
- **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0)**: The speech is too casual, with phrases like "in short" and a lack of proper citations for research references.
