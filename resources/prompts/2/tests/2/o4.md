### Sentence Count
- Formula: Count the number of sentences
- Intermediate calculations: *"Okay, so today, I want to talk about hate speech. It's a big issue on social media, and we need to stop it. First, I will discuss the impact of hate speech on mental health. Then, I will talk about how social media platforms are addressing it. Finally, I will present some alternative solutions. Hate speech causes psychological harm and contributes to social division. Researchers like Smith (2022) have found that repeated exposure to online hate leads to increased anxiety and depression. Furthermore, a study by Jones et al. (2021) suggests that AI-based moderation is improving but still flawed. A useful analogy is to think of social media as a garden; if we don't remove the weeds (hate speech), they will overrun the space. In short, hate speech is a problem, and, um, yeah, we should do something about it. Any questions?"
