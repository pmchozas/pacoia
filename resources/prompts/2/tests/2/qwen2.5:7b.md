## Detailed Grade Evidence

### Introduction
- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenario—"Okay, so today, I want to talk about hate speech. It's a big issue on social media, and we need to stop it." This is somewhat engaging 
but lacks creativity.*
- **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (1)**
  - *Evidence: "I will discuss the impact of hate speech on mental health. Then, I will talk about how social media platforms are addressing it. Finally, I will present some alternative 
solutions." The topic is clearly introduced and outlined.*
- **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker mentions three main points but does not provide a clear or detailed structure.*

### Organization
- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: Transitions are somewhat present, e.g., "First, I will discuss the impact of hate speech on mental health." However, there is no clear closing statement for each section.*
- **Has a logical progression of ideas (1)**
  - *Evidence: The content flows logically from discussing the impact to addressing solutions.*
- **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: While the structure is generally balanced, the speaker's filler words ("um") indicate uneven pacing.*

### Content
- **Adapts the content to the audience (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The content is clear but lacks specific audience engagement strategies.*
- **Shows evidence of literature research (1)**
  - *Evidence: References are provided from Smith (2022) and Jones et al. (2021), indicating proper use of academic sources.*
- **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker uses the analogy "social media as a garden," but it is not fully developed.*

### Conclusion
- **Summarizes main points effectively (1)**
  - *Evidence: The conclusion succinctly reiterates the key points.*
- **Relates to the introduction (1)**
  - *Evidence: The conclusion ties back to the opening by summarizing and reinforcing the importance of addressing hate speech.*
- **Invites questions effectively (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker ends with "Any questions?" which is a basic invitation but lacks any further encouragement or detail.*

### Vocal Delivery
- **Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The presence of filler words ("um") indicates some hesitation and lack of fluency.*
  
### Language
- **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: While the speech uses formal terms, it includes filler phrases like "Okay," which are not typical in formal speech.*
- **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (1)**
  - *Evidence: The use of terms like "hate speech," "mental health," "AI-based moderation" demonstrates a rich and varied vocabulary.*
- **Uses grammar correctly (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: Grammar errors, such as the filler words, indicate some grammatical issues.*

Overall, the speech shows promise but could benefit from more refined structure, engagement strategies, and fluency in delivery. The inclusion of references and formal language is a positive 
aspect, but there are areas for improvement in flow and clarity.
