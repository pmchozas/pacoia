# Improvements

## Problems
- Formulas are invented
- Some metrics are never calculated (Hedging)
- Should add more formulas
- Formulas do not follow the wanted format
- The spotting of words given is normally not done
- Sometimes the categories are not respected

## Possible solutions
- Add Formulas so there is no confusion
- Indicate more explicitly the necessity of calculating the metrics
- Add more formulas
- Give an example of the output wanted for the formulas
- Indicate more explicitly the necessity of spotting words
- Emphasize the importance of only responding with the available categories
