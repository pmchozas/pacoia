### Introduction Evidence 
- *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenarioâ€”"Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform, 
only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages." This effectively engages the audience by creating an emotional and relatable opening.*

### Conclusion Evidence 
- *Evidence: The speaker concludes abruptly without summarizing main points effectively. The phrase "any questions?" feels abrupt and lacks closure.*
