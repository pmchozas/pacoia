**Cohesion index**: 
- Formula: Cohesion Index = (Number of cohesive elements) / (Total number of clauses)
- Intermediate Calculations:
  - Number of cohesive elements: 6 (e.g., "First," "Then," "Finally")
  - Total number of clauses: 8
- Calculation: Cohesion Index = 6 / 8 = 0.75

**Reasoning Score**: 
- Formula: Reasoning Score = (Number of logical transitions) / (Total number of sentences)
- Intermediate Calculations:
  - Number of logical transitions: 4 (e.g., "Furthermore," "In short")
  - Total number of sentences: 8
- Calculation: Reasoning Score = 4 / 8 = 0.5

**Argumentative density**: 
- Formula: Argumentative Density = (Number of argumentative statements) / (Total number of clauses)
- Intermediate Calculations:
  - Number of argumentative statements: 3 ("Researchers like Smith (2022) have found that repeated exposure to online hate leads to increased anxiety and 
depression," "A study by Jones et al. (2021) suggests that AI-based moderation is improving but still flawed")
  - Total number of clauses: 8
- Calculation: Argumentative Density = 3 / 8 = 0.375

**Conclusion**
- **Introduction**
  - **Well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**
    - *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenario—"Okay, so today, I want to talk about hate speech. It's a big issue on social media, and we need to 
stop it." This effectively engages the audience by introducing the topic directly.*
  - **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (1)**
    - *Evidence: The introduction clearly states "today, I want to talk about hate speech" which sets the main theme of the presentation.*
  - **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: The speaker outlines the structure—impact on mental health, addressing it by platforms, and alternative solutions—which helps the audience 
follow along.*

- **Organization**
  - **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (signposting) (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: The use of "First," "Then," and "Finally" signals the structure but is not consistently applied throughout the speech.*
  - **Has a logical progression of ideas (1)**
    - *Evidence: The ideas flow logically from the impact on mental health to addressing it by platforms, and then to alternative solutions.*
  - **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: Each section is roughly equal in length and covers relevant content, but "Finally" feels rushed.*

- **Content**
  - **Adapts the content to the audience (1)**
    - *Evidence: The language is accessible and the examples provided are relatable.*
  - **Shows evidence of literature research (oral citations or references to previous research) (0)**
    - *Evidence: While references are mentioned, they are not fully integrated into the speech. Citing Smith (2022) and Jones et al. (2021) in context would 
enhance this score.*
  - **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: The analogy of social media as a garden is included, which adds clarity but could be more engaging.*

- **Conclusion**
  - **Summarizes main points effectively (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: The conclusion summarizes the key points but lacks depth and reiteration.*
  - **Relates to the introduction (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: It returns to the idea of stopping hate speech, which ties back to the opening statement.*
  - **Invites questions effectively (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: The speaker asks for questions at the end, but it feels like an afterthought.*

- **Vocal delivery**
  - **Fluently, avoiding frequent repetitions, hesitations and gap fillers (0)**
    - *Evidence: There are noticeable gaps and filler words ("um," "yeah") which detract from fluency.*
  
- **Language**
  - **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0.5)**
    - *Evidence: The speech includes some formal terms but also informal phrases, leaning more towards casual speech.*
  - **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (1)**
    - *Evidence: The use of technical terms like "hate speech," "AI-based moderation" contributes to the topic richness.*
  - **Uses grammar correctly (1)**
    - *Evidence: Despite some filler words, the overall structure and grammar are correct.*
