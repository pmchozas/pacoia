#### Cohesion Index
- Formula: Cohesion Index = (Number of cohesive ties) / (Total sentences)
- Result: Cohesion Index = 6 / 10 = 0.6

#### Reasoning Score
- Formula: Reasoning Score = (Number of logical connectors and argumentation markers) / (Total sentences)
- Result: Reasoning Score = 5 / 10 = 0.5

#### Argumentative Density
- Formula: Argumentative Density = (Number of argumentative claims and supporting evidence) / (Total sentences) 
- Result: Argumentative Density = 4 / 10 = 0.4

#### Formality Index Calculation  
- Formula: Formality Index = (Number of formal expressions) / (Number of informal expressions + contractions + fillers)
- Result: Formality Index = 3 / (4 + 0 + 2) = 3 / 6 = 0.5
  
#### Hedging Evaluation 
- Formula: Hedging Evaluation = (Number of hedging words) / (Total sentences)
- Result: Hedging Evaluation = 0 / 10 = 0.0

#### Type-Token Ratio Calculation 
- Formula: TTR = (Number of unique words) / (Total words)
