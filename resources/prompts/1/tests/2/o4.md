### Metric Calculations  

#### Cohesion Index  
Formula: Cohesion Index = (Number of cohesive ties) / (Total sentences)  
- Cohesive ties (e.g., pronouns, conjunctions, references): **6**  
  - "First," "Then," "Finally," "Furthermore," "In short," "and"  
- Total sentences: **10**  
- Cohesion Index = 6 / 10 = **0.6**  

#### Reasoning Score  
Formula: Reasoning Score = (Number of logical connectors and argumentation markers) / (Total sentences)  
- Logical connectors: **5**  
  - "First," "Then," "Finally," "Furthermore," "In short"  
- Reasoning Score = 5 / 10 = **0.5**  

#### Argumentative Density  
Formula: Argumentative Density = (Number of argumentative claims and supporting evidence) / (Total sentences)  
- Argumentative claims and evidence: **4**  
  - "Hate speech causes psychological harm and contributes to social division."  
  - "Researchers like Smith (2022) have found that repeated exposure to online hate leads to increased anxiety and depression."  
  - "A study by Jones et al. (2021) suggests that AI-based moderation is improving but still flawed."  
  - "A useful analogy is to think of social media as a garden; if we don't remove the weeds (hate speech), they will overrun the space."  
- Argumentative Density = 4 / 10 = **0.4**  

#### Formality Index  
Formula: Formality Index = (Number of formal expressions) / (Number of informal expressions + contractions + fillers)  
- Formal expressions: **3** ("Furthermore," "Researchers like Smith (2022) have found," "A study by Jones et al. (2021) suggests")  
- Informal expressions: **4** ("Okay," "so," "yeah," "um")  
- Contractions: **0**  
- Fillers: **2** ("um," "yeah")  
- Formality Index = 3 / (4 + 0 + 2) = 3 / 6 = **0.5**  

#### Hedging Evaluation  
Formula: Hedging Evaluation = (Number of hedging words) / (Total sentences)  
- Hedging words found: **0**  
- Hedging Evaluation = 0 / 10 = **0.0**  

#### Type-Token Ratio  
Formula: TTR = (Number of unique words) / (Total words)  
- Unique words: **29**  
- Total words: **75**  
- Type-Token Ratio = 29 / 75 = **0.387**  

### Linguistic Features Found  

**Signposting**: First, Then, Finally, Furthermore, In short  
**Contractions**: None  
**Exaggerations**: None  
**Fillers**: okay, so, um, yeah  
**Informal**: okay, so, yeah  
**Subjective**: None  
**Vague**: None

### Grading Evidence  

#### Introduction  
- **Well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (0)**  
  - *Evidence: The speech starts with "Okay, so today, I want to talk about hate speech," which lacks a compelling or engaging hook.*  
- **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (1)**  
  - *Evidence: The speaker explicitly states, "I want to talk about hate speech. It's a big issue on social media, and we need to stop it."*  
- **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (1)**  
  - *Evidence: The speaker clearly outlines the speech structure: "First, I will discuss... Then, I will talk about... Finally, I will present..."*  

#### Organization  
- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (1)**  
  - *Evidence: Use of signposting words—"First," "Then," "Finally," "Furthermore," "In short"—provides structure.*  
- **Has a logical progression of ideas (1)**  
  - *Evidence: The speech moves from defining the issue, explaining its effects, discussing current solutions, and ending with alternatives.*  
- **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**  
  - *Evidence: The conclusion is rushed ("In short, hate speech is a problem, and, um, yeah, we should do something about it"), making it less balanced compared to other sections.*  

#### Content  
- **Adapts the content to the audience (1)**  
  - *Evidence: The speaker assumes awareness of social media and references psychological impacts, making the topic relevant.*  
- **Shows evidence of literature research (1)**  
  - *Evidence: Two studies are cited—Smith (2022) and Jones et al. (2021).*  
- **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (1)**  
  - *Evidence: "A useful analogy is to think of social media as a garden; if we don't remove the weeds (hate speech), they will overrun the space."*  

#### Conclusion  
- **Summarizes main points effectively (0.5)**  
  - *Evidence: The phrase "In short, hate speech is a problem" attempts to summarize but lacks depth.*  
- **Relates to the introduction (0.5)**  
  - *Evidence: The conclusion briefly echoes the problem mentioned at the start but without reinforcement.*  
- **Invites questions effectively (0.5)**  
  - *Evidence: Ends with "Any questions?" but without a formal invitation to engage.*  

#### Vocal Delivery  
- **Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (0)**  
  - *Evidence: Presence of "um," "yeah," "okay, so," indicating hesitations and fillers.*  

#### Language  
- **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0.5)**  
  - *Evidence: Formal phrases like "Furthermore" and academic citations appear, but informal elements ("okay," "so," "yeah") reduce overall formality.*  
- **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (1)**  
  - *Evidence: Contains terms like "psychological harm," "social division," "moderation," "anxiety," "depression."*  
- **Uses grammar correctly (1)**
