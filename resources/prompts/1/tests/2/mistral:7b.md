   ### Evaluation Results Explanation

   - The introduction includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener as it starts with an engaging scenario ("Imagine logging onto your 
favorite social media platform, only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages.") that effectively engages the audience by creating an emotional and 
relatable opening. (Grade: 1)
   - The theme or topic is introduced clearly (hate speech on social media and its impact), although it could have been more explicitly stated as the main 
focus of the presentation. (Grade: 0.5)
   - The outline of the presentation is not explicitly shown, but it can be inferred from the given structure. (Grade: 0)
   - Each section opens and closes with clear transitions using signposting such as "First," "Then," and "Finally." (Grade: 1)
   - The content presents a logical progression of ideas, starting with the impact of hate speech on mental health, moving to how social media platforms are 
addressing it, and finishing with alternative solutions. (Grade: 1)
   - Although no visual metaphor or simile is explicitly stated, the analogy of "social media as a garden" provides a clear image for understanding the 
problem and solution. (Grade: 0)
   - The content adapts to the audience by discussing an issue relevant to social media users. (Grade: 0.5)
   - Evidence of literature research is provided through oral citations to previous research by Smith (2022) and Jones et al. (2021). (Grade: 1)
   - The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points, although it could have been more succinct. (Grade: 0.5)
   - The conclusion relates to the introduction by tying back to the problem of hate speech on social media and inviting questions. (Grade: 0.5)
   - The vocal delivery is mostly fluent, with occasional hesitations and gap fillers. (Grade: 0.5)
   - The language employs characteristics of spoken formal language, uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary, and uses grammar correctly. (Grade: 0.5, 1, 
1 respectively)
