I'll follow the format to evaluate the speech transcript.

**Cohesion index**: This metric measures the degree of coherence between ideas in the text. To calculate it, I will use the formula: (Number of cohesive 
ties / Total number of words) x 100.
From the transcript, there are approximately 206 words and 7 cohesive ties ("like", "um", "and stuff", "for making social media a safer place"). However, 
upon closer inspection, most of these instances are fillers or informal expressions, which do not contribute to cohesion.

**Result:** **0.34%**

**Reasoning Score**: This metric assesses the complexity and depth of reasoning in the text. To calculate it, I will use the formula: (Number of complex 
sentences / Total number of sentences) x 100.
The transcript contains approximately 13 sentences. Most of them are simple or compound, with only a few instances of complex sentences.

**Result:** **20%**

**Organization**: This criterion evaluates how well the text is structured and organized. I will use the following metrics:
- Transitions: (Number of signposting words / Total number of words) x 100
- Logical progression: (Total number of logical connections / Total number of sentences) x 100

Transitions: There are no explicit transitions or signposting words in the transcript.

**Result:** **0%**

Logical progression: The text lacks a clear logical progression, with ideas jumping between different topics (hate speech laws, tech companies' role, and 
individual responsibility).

**Result:** **20%**

**Content**: This criterion assesses the relevance, accuracy, and depth of information in the text. I will use the following metrics:
- Relevance: (Number of relevant points / Total number of ideas) x 100
- Accuracy: (Number of accurate statements / Total number of statements) x 100

Relevance: The transcript touches on several relevant points regarding hate speech and social media, but it lacks depth and fails to provide concrete 
examples or evidence.

**Result:** **50%**

Accuracy: Some statements in the transcript are inaccurate or exaggerated ("words can be as dangerous as weapons").

**Result:** **40%**

**Conclusion**: This criterion evaluates how well the text summarizes main points and relates back to the introduction. I will use the following metrics:
- Summary: (Number of main points summarized / Total number of ideas) x 100
- Relation to introduction: (Number of connections between conclusion and introduction / Total number of sentences) x 100

Summary: The transcript fails to provide a clear summary of its main points, leaving the audience with incomplete information.

**Result:** **30%**

Relation to introduction: There is no clear connection between the conclusion and the introduction.

**Result:** **20%**

**Vocal delivery**: This criterion assesses the fluency and effectiveness of the speaker's delivery. I will use the following metrics:
- Fluency: (Number of filler words / Total number of words) x 100
- Effectiveness: (Effectiveness in engaging the audience / Total number of sentences) x 100

Fluency: The transcript contains numerous filler words ("like", "um"), which detract from its overall effectiveness.

**Result:** **40%**

Effectiveness: The speech fails to engage the audience effectively, with a weak and unclear conclusion.

**Result:** **30%**

**Language**: This criterion evaluates the use of formal language, vocabulary, and grammar. I will use the following metrics:
- Formality: (Number of formal expressions / Total number of words) x 100
- Vocabulary richness: (Number of topically rich words / Total number of words) x 100
- Grammar accuracy: (Number of grammatically correct sentences / Total number of sentences) x 100

Formality: The transcript uses informal language, with a high frequency of colloquial expressions ("like", "stuff").

**Result:** **20%**

Vocabulary richness: The transcript contains some topically rich words, but they are not consistently used throughout the text.

**Result:** **40%**

Grammar accuracy: There are several grammatical errors in the transcript (e.g., "So, like, um, governments have laws...").

**Result:** **30%**
