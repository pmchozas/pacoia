**Cohesion index**: 0.5

- The text uses some transitions such as "Then, I will explore" and "Lastly," which is good.
- However, there are many filler words like "um" and "like" that disrupt the flow and cohesion.

**Reasoning Score**: 0.5

- Reasoning is present but often weak due to informal language and fillers ("stuff," "um").
- For example: "governments have laws, and stuff, about hate speech" lacks clear logical reasoning.

**Argumentative density**: 0.5

- The argument is somewhat dense with the idea that words can be dangerous.
- However, the use of filler words and vague language ("stuff") reduces its effectiveness.

**Formality index**: 0.25

- There are many contractions like "I'll" instead of "I will," and informal phrases like "Let's take responsibility."
- The overall tone is too casual for a formal speech, though some terms such as "hate speech" are used formally.
- Filler words and filler phrases ("um," "like") further reduce the formality.

**Grade Evidence**

### Introduction
- **Well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**
  - *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenarioâ€”"Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform, 
  only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages." This effectively engages the audience by creating an emotional and relatable opening.*
  
- **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The introduction clearly states that hate speech on social media can harm reputations, mental health, 
  and fuel violence. However, it uses informal language like "stuff," which slightly reduces its clarity.*

- **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker mentions three main points: legal landscape, role of tech companies, and practical steps for individuals.
  However, these points are not clearly outlined in a structured manner due to filler words like "um" and "like."*

### Organization
- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (signposting) (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: Transitions such as "Then, I will explore" and "Lastly," but they are often disrupted by fillers ("um," "stuff").*

- **Has a logical progression of ideas (1)**
  - *Evidence: The main points have a logical flow from legal landscape to tech companies to individual actions.*

- **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The structure is somewhat balanced, but the use of filler words like "um" and "like" disrupts the flow.*

### Content
- **Adapts the content to the audience (1)**
  - *Evidence: The speech uses relatable scenarios ("imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform") which help engage the audience.*

- **Shows evidence of literature research (oral citations or references to previous research) (0)**
  - *Evidence: No specific oral citations or references are provided, and the language is too informal for academic context.*

- **Includes a visual metaphor or simile to clarify an idea (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The comparison of words to weapons is used but not developed fully due to filler words ("stuff").*

### Conclusion
- **Summarizes main points effectively (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The conclusion summarizes the main points, but it uses informal language and fillers ("um," "like").*

- **Relates to the introduction (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The conclusion returns to the idea of responsibility for making social media safer, but the use of filler words reduces its effectiveness.*

- **Invites questions effectively (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: The speaker thanks the audience and invites questions, which is a good practice, but it could be more effective with better language.*

### Vocal Delivery
- **Fluently, avoiding frequent repetitions, hesitations and gap fillers (0)**
  - *Evidence: Frequent use of filler words like "um" and "like," along with repeated phrases ("stuff"), disrupts fluency.*

### Language
- **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: Some terms are used formally, but the overall tone is too casual due to fillers and informal language.*

- **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (1)**
  - *Evidence: The use of words like "hate speech," "reputations," and "mental health" shows a good range of vocabulary relevant to the topic.*

- **Uses grammar correctly (0.5)**
  - *Evidence: While there are no major grammatical errors, the frequent use of filler words and informal language slightly reduces this score.*
