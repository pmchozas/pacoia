   ### Evaluation Results Explanation

   - **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**: The speech starts with a vivid and relatable scenario, "Imagine logging onto 
your favorite social media platform, only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages," which effectively engages the audience.
   - **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (0.5)**: While the theme is introduced, it could be made more clear and concise, as the speaker spends 
time setting up the scenario before introducing the main topic, "I will discuss how we can address this growing problem."
   - **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (0.5)**: The speaker outlines the three main points to be covered in the speech: legal landscape 
surrounding hate speech, role of tech companies in controlling harmful content, and practical steps individuals can take. However, this outline could be 
more explicitly stated and structured for easier understanding.
   - **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (1)**: The speaker effectively opens and closes each section by signposting ("So..." to 
introduce a new topic and "Thank you!" to conclude the speech).
   - **Has a logical progression of ideas (1)**: The presentation logically moves from discussing legal aspects, tech companies' role, to practical steps 
individuals can take.
   - **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**: While the speech covers three main points, there seems to be an uneven balance between them, 
with a relatively longer introduction and conclusion compared to the body of the speech.
   - **Adapts the content to the audience (1)**: The topic is relevant and engaging for a general audience on social media platforms.
   - **Shows evidence of literature research (0)**: No oral citations or references to previous research were made during the speech.
   - **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (0)**: No visual metaphors or similes were used in the speech to clarify an idea.
   - **Summarizes main points effectively (0.5)**: The speaker does provide a brief summary of the main points in the conclusion but could be more concise 
and effective, as some key details might get lost.
   - **Relates to the introduction (0.5)**: While the speaker does return to the initial scenario mentioned in the introduction, it is not explicitly linked 
back to the theme or topic of the speech, allowing for room for improvement.
   - **Invites questions effectively (1)**: The speaker effectively invites questions by saying, "Thank you!" and encouraging the audience to take action, 
suggesting they play an active role in making social media a safer place.
   - **Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (0.25)**: The speech contains some pauses, repetitions, and filler words ("um" and "like") which could be 
reduced to improve fluency and clarity.
   - **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (1)**: The speaker uses appropriate tone, vocabulary, and structure for a formal presentation, 
making the speech easy to understand and engaging.
   - **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (1)**: The speaker employs varied and appropriate words related to the topic, keeping the audience engaged 
and informed.
   - **Uses grammar correctly (1)**: No grammatical errors were observed in the speech.
