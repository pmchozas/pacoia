### Metric Calculations  

#### **Cohesion Index**  
Formula: (Number of cohesive devices) / (Total sentences)  
- Cohesive devices found: *Then*, *Lastly*, *Also*, *As I mentioned in the beginning* (4)  
- Total sentences: 10  
- **Cohesion Index** = 4/10 = **0.4**  

#### **Reasoning Score**  
Formula: (Number of logical connections) / (Total arguments)  
- Logical connections: *I will discuss*, *I will start by discussing*, *Then*, *Lastly*, *As I mentioned in the beginning* (5)  
- Total arguments: Hate speech's impact, legal landscape, role of tech companies, individual responsibility (4)  
- **Reasoning Score** = 5/4 = **1.25**  

#### **Argumentative Density**  
Formula: (Number of arguments) / (Total words)  
- Total arguments: 4  
- Total words: 98  
- **Argumentative Density** = 4/98 = **0.041**  

#### **Formality Index**  
Formula: (Formal structures) / (Informal structures)  
- Formal structures: *I will discuss*, *I will start by discussing*, *Lastly, I will suggest practical steps* (3)  
- Informal structures: *Like*, *Um*, *Stuff*, *You know*, *Super* (5)  
- **Formality Index** = 3/5 = **0.6**  

#### **Hedging Evaluation**  
Formula: (Number of hedging words) / (Total words)  
- Hedging words found: *Should* (1)  
- **Hedging Evaluation** = 1/98 = **0.01**  

#### **Type-Token Ratio (TTR)**  
Formula: (Unique words) / (Total words)  
- Unique words: 64  
- Total words: 98  
- **Type-Token Ratio** = 64/98 = **0.65**

### Evaluation Evidence  

#### **Introduction**  
- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**  
  - *Evidence: The speech opens with a thought-provoking question—"What if I told you that words could be as dangerous as weapons?" This effectively captures the audience's attention.*  
- **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (1)**  
  - *Evidence: The speaker immediately states the central idea—"Hate speech on social media has the power to destroy reputations, harm mental health, and fuel violence."*

#### **Organization**  
- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (0.5)**  
  - *Evidence: Signposting is used ("Then," "Lastly"), but some transitions are abrupt, especially before the conclusion.*  
- **Has a logical progression of ideas (0.5)**  
  - *Evidence: While the order is reasonable, the discussion on laws is unclear ("Governments have laws and stuff"), reducing clarity.*  
- **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**

#### **Content**  
- **Adapts the content to the audience (0.5)**
