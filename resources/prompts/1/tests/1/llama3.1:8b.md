## Calculating the metrics

### Cohesion Index
The Cohesion Index measures the degree to which the text is cohesive.

 Formula: CI = (Number of Cohesive Devices / Total Number of Words) x 100

Intermediate calculations:
Total words in the transcript: 126
Cohesive devices found: 
* transitional phrases: "Today", "One way to address...", "Another approach"
* connectives: "However", "To conclude"

CI = (3 / 126) x 100 ≈ 2.38

**Cohesion index**: 2.38

### Reasoning Score
The Reasoning Score measures the complexity of reasoning in the text.

 Formula: RS = (Number of Abstract Concepts + Number of Evaluative Language) / Total Number of Words

Intermediate calculations:
Abstract concepts found: "hate speech", "content moderation", "digital literacy education"
Evaluative language found: "this is unfortunate", "however"

RS = (3 + 2) / 126 ≈ 0.0476

**Reasoning Score**: 0.0476

### Argumentative Density
The Argumentative Density measures the degree to which the text presents arguments.

 Formula: AD = (Number of Claims + Number of Evidence) / Total Number of Words

Intermediate calculations:
Claims found: "One way to address hate speech is through content moderation", "Another approach is digital literacy education"
Evidence found: "some argue that this infringes on freedom of expression"

AD = (2 + 1) / 126 ≈ 0.0159

**Argumentative Density**: 0.0159

### Content
The Content measure assesses the relevance and accuracy of the information presented.

 Formula: C = (Number of Accurate Information + Number of Relevant Sources) / Total Number of Words

Intermediate calculations:
Accurate information found: "hate speech", "content moderation", "digital literacy education"
Relevant sources not found in the transcript

C = (3 / 126) ≈ 0.0238

**Content**: 0.0238

### Conclusion
The Conclusion measure evaluates how effectively the text summarizes and relates to the introduction.

 Formula: C = (Number of Effective Summary + Number of Relating to Introduction) / Total Number of Words

Intermediate calculations:
Effective summary found: "To conclude, tackling hate speech requires multiple solutions"
Relating to introduction not found in the transcript

C = (1 / 126) ≈ 0.0079

**Conclusion**: 0.0079

### Vocal Delivery
The Vocal Delivery measure assesses the speaker's ability to deliver the content effectively.

 Formula: VD = (Number of Clear Transitions + Number of Effective Use of Rhetorical Devices) / Total Number of Words

Intermediate calculations:
Clear transitions found: "Today", "One way to address...", "Another approach"
Effective use of rhetorical devices not found in the transcript
Fillers and hesitations found: "uh", "so yeah"

VD = (3 / 126) ≈ 0.0238, adjusted for fillers and hesitations: VD ≈ 0

**Vocal Delivery**: 0

### Language
The Language measure evaluates the speaker's use of formal language.

 Formula: L = (Number of Formal Vocabulary + Number of Correct Grammar) / Total Number of Words

Intermediate calculations:
Formal vocabulary found: "unfortunate", "infringes on freedom of expression"
Correct grammar not checked due to complexity and limitations of this task

L ≈ (2 / 126)

**Language**: 0.0159
