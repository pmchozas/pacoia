### Metric Calculations  

#### Cohesion Index Calculation  
**Formula:** Cohesion Index = Number of cohesive devices / Total number of sentences  
- Cohesive devices: "One way," "However," "Another approach," "To conclude" → 4  
- Total sentences: 7  
**Cohesion Index = 4 / 7 = 0.57**  

#### Reasoning Score Calculation  
**Formula:** Reasoning Score = (Number of reasoned arguments / Total number of arguments) × 100  
- Reasoned arguments: "One way to address hate speech is through content moderation" and "Another approach is digital literacy education" (both provide explanations) → 2  
- Total arguments: 3 ("One way to address hate speech…", "However, some argue…", "Another approach…")  
**Reasoning Score = (2 / 3) × 100 = 66.67**  

#### Argumentative Density Calculation  
**Formula:** Argumentative Density = Number of arguments / Total number of words  
- Total words: 55  
**Argumentative Density = 3 / 55 = 0.055 (5.5%)**  

#### Formality Index Calculation  
**Formula:** Formality Index = (Formal words - Informal words) / Total words  
- Informal words: "uh," "so yeah" → 2  
- Formal words: "strategies," "combat," "ensuring," "empowers" → 4  
**Formality Index = (4 - 2) / 55 = 0.036 (3.6%)**  

#### Hedging Evaluation  
**Formula:** Hedging Evaluation = Number of hedging expressions / Total number of sentences  
- Hedging expressions: "some argue" → 1  
**Hedging Evaluation = 1 / 7 = 0.14**  

#### Type-Token Ratio Calculation  
**Formula:** Type-Token Ratio = (Unique words / Total words) × 100  
- Unique words: 41  
- Total words: 55  
**Type-Token Ratio = (41 / 55) × 100 = 74.55**  

### Metric Results  

**Cohesion index**: 0.57  
**Reasoning Score**: 66.67  
**Argumentative density**: 5.5%  
**Formality index**: 3.6%  
**Hedging evaluation**: 0.14  
**Type-Token Ratio**: 74.55

### Evaluation Evidence  

#### Introduction  
- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**  
  *Evidence: The speech starts with a vivid scenario—"Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform, only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages." This effectively engages the audience by creating an emotional and relatable opening.*  
- **Sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly (1)**  
  *Evidence: "Today, I will explore effective strategies to combat hate speech on social media." This sentence explicitly introduces the topic.*  
- **Shows the outline of the presentation appropriately (0.5)**  
  *Evidence: The speech presents two approaches ("One way…," "Another approach…") but does not clearly outline the structure of the talk in advance.*  

#### Organization  
- **Opens and closes each section with clear transitions (1)**  
  *Evidence: Uses clear signposting ("One way," "However," "Another approach," "To conclude").*  
- **Has a logical progression of ideas (1)**  
  *Evidence: The arguments build sequentially, first discussing content moderation, countering it with concerns, and then proposing an alternative.*  
- **Balances parts in terms of length and content (0.5)**  
  *Evidence: The introduction and main points are balanced, but the conclusion is abrupt with fillers ("uh... so yeah").*  

#### Content  
- **Adapts the content to the audience (1)**  
  *Evidence: The speech discusses real-world issues that affect social media users, making it relevant and engaging.*  
- **Shows evidence of literature research (0)**  
  *Evidence: No references to studies, experts, or data.*  
- **Includes a visual metaphor or simile (0)**  
  *Evidence: No figurative language used.*  

#### Conclusion  
- **Summarizes main points effectively (0.5)**  
  *Evidence: "To conclude, tackling hate speech requires multiple solutions…" provides a summary, but it is weak due to the informal closing.*  
- **Relates to the introduction (0.5)**  
  *Evidence: Returns to the problem of hate speech but does not strongly connect back to the opening scenario.*  
- **Invites questions effectively (0.5)**  
  *Evidence: Ends with "Any questions?" but lacks a formal transition.*  

#### Vocal Delivery  
- **Fluency (avoiding hesitations and fillers) (0)**  
  *Evidence: The presence of fillers ("uh... so yeah") reduces fluency.*  

#### Language  
- **Employs characteristics of spoken formal language (0.5)**  
  *Evidence: Mostly formal, but fillers and slight informality lower the score.*  
- **Uses topically rich and diverse vocabulary (1)**  
  *Evidence: Words like "strategies," "combat," "empowers," "moderation" contribute to lexical diversity.*  
- **Uses grammar correctly (1)**  
  *Evidence: No significant grammatical errors detected.*
