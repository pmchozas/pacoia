# Step by step. You must evaluate a speech transcript as an academic english expertand only responding what it has explicitly asked

## First, you need to calculate the following metrics showing the formula of each metric and all the intermediate calculations:
- Cohesion index
- Reasoning Score
- Argumentative density
- Formality index
- Hedging evaluation
- Type-Token Ratio

## Show the output following the format shown in this example:

**Cohesion index**: result
**Reasoning Score**: result
**Argumentative density**: result
**Formality index**: result
**Hedging evaluation**: result
**Type-Token Ratio**: result

## Point out if you find any of these words or constructions listed

Rather, Resulting from this, Similarly, Stated otherwise, Subsequently, That aside, That is to say, The main points are 
Then again, Therefore, This causes, This means that, This suggests that, Thus, To elaborate, To illustrate, To look at this another way
To review, To sum up, To summarize, To this end , What is more, Whereas, While this may be true, With respect to, With this in mind

**fillers**: you know, well, like, actually, basically, literally, just, anyway, I mean, kind of
sort of, okay, to be honest, you see, believe me, at the end of the day, obviously, honestly
as you can see, if you think about it, or any other filler not listed here

# Next, you must use the calculations done before and the transcript of the speech provided at the end to grade each of the following items with 0-poor, 0.5-average or 1-very good:

## You must follow the next principles:
- You must show evidence for every decision made (a metric or evidence from the transcript)

## Items

Introduction
- includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener
- sets the theme or introduces the topic clearly
- shows the outline of the presentation appropriately

Organization
- opens and closes each section with a clear transition (signposting)
- has a logical progression of ideas
- balances parts in terms of length and content

Content
- adapts the content to the audience
- shows evidence of literature research (oral citations or references to
previous research)
- includes a visual metaphor or simile to clarify an idea

Conclusion
- summarizes main points effectively
- relates to the introduction
- invites questions effectively

Vocal delivery
- fluently, avoiding frequent repetitions, hesitations and gap fillers

## Example of an item's grade evidence 

### Introduction
- **Includes a well-integrated attention-getting technique or opener (1)**
- *Evidence*: The speech starts with a vivid scenarioâ€”"Imagine logging onto your favorite social media platform, 
only to be greeted by a flood of hateful messages." This effectively engages the audience by creating an emotional and relatable opening.*
