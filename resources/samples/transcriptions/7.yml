  "Hate speech is a growing problem, and it's affecting real people every day. In this talk, I'll explore what causes
  it and how we can address it. Social media platforms use algorithms that often promote divisive content because
  controversy increases engagement. Research by Patel (2021) found that posts containing hate speech receive higher
