  "Okay, so today, I want to talk about hate speech. It's a big issue on social media, and we need to stop it.
  First, I will discuss the impact of hate speech on mental health. Then, I will talk about how social media
  platforms are addressing it. Finally, I will present some alternative solutions. Hate speech causes psychological
  harm and contributes to social division. Researchers like Smith (2022) have found that repeated exposure to online
  hate leads to increased anxiety and depression. Furthermore, a study by Jones et al. (2021) suggests that AI-based
  moderation is improving but still flawed. A useful analogy is to think of social media as a garden; if we don't remove
  the weeds (hate speech), they will overrun the space. In short, hate speech is a problem, and, um, yeah, we should do
  something about it. Any questions?"
