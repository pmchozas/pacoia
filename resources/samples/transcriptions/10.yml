  "Picture a world where online spaces are free of hostility and discrimination. Unfortunately, hate speech is a
  growing issue that prevents this from becoming a reality. In this speech, I will examine the causes of online hate
  speech, its effects, and potential solutions. First, we need to understand why hate speech spreads. Next, I will
  discuss the role of social media companies in tackling this problem. Finally, I will share strategies individuals
  can use to counteract hate speech. Research by Kim (2021) suggests that misinformation fuels hate speech, making
  it difficult to regulate effectively. However, companies such as Facebook and Twitter have introduced policies to
  curb harmful rhetoric. Think of online hate as a wildfireâ€”once ignited, it spreads rapidly unless immediate action
  is taken. So, yeah, that's it. I hope, uh, this was helpful. Thanks."
