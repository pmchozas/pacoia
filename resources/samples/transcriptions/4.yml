  "Have you ever wondered how hate speech spreads so rapidly online? Today, I will explain why this happens and how we can
  counteract it. First, I will define hate speech and its legal implications. Then, I will discuss how algorithms contribute
  to the problem. Finally, I will suggest solutions that social media users can adopt. Research by Cohen (2020) found that
  social media algorithms tend to amplify divisive content. This is because engagement-driven algorithms prioritize sensationalism
  over accuracy. A useful metaphor is to think of these algorithms as a wildfire: once sparked, they can spread uncontrollably.
  So, um, I hope this helps you understand hate speech. Uh, any questions?"
