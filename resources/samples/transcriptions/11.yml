  "Uh, so, hate speech is a thing. And, like, it's a problem. Today, I'll talk about what it is and how we can stop it.
  So first, um, yeah, people say mean stuff online. Then, social media companies, like, have policies, right? And then,
  um, we need better solutions. Research by Thompson (2020) found that unchecked hate speech can lead to real-world violence.
  Additionally, social media platforms face criticism for inconsistent enforcement of their policies. Hate speech is like a
  virusâ€”it spreads and infects online discourse, creating a hostile environment. To sum up, hate speech doesn't just exist
  online; it affects real people. By taking action, we can create a safer and more respectful digital world. Thank you."
