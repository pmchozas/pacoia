  "What if I told you that words could be as dangerous as weapons? Hate speech on social media has the power to destroy
  reputations, harm mental health, and fuel violence. Today, I will discuss how we can address this growing problem.
  I will start by discussing the legal landscape surrounding hate speech. Then, I will explore the role of tech companies
  in controlling harmful content. Lastly, I will suggest practical steps that individuals can take. So, like, um, governments
  have laws, and stuff, about hate speech, but, like, it's super complicated, and, you know, social media companies have, like,
  terms and stuff. Um, and also, we, like, should be careful, right? As I mentioned in the beginning, words can be weapons.
  If we do not regulate hate speech, we allow these weapons to be freely used. Let's take responsibility for making social
  media a safer place. Thank you!"
