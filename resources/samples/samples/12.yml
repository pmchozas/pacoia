  "What if I told you that the words we use online could shape the future of our society? Hate speech is a serious issue, and in this
  speech, I'll discuss why it matters and what we can do about it. First, I will define hate speech and examine its impact. Then,
  I will explore the role of government policies and social media regulations. Finally, I will suggest practical solutions that
  individuals can apply. According to a study by Johnson (2023), exposure to hate speech can normalize discriminatory beliefs,
  leading to real-world consequences. Furthermore, platforms like YouTube have developed AI-based moderation, yet these systems
  are not perfect. Think of hate speech like secondhand smokeâ€”it doesn't just harm the person using it but affects everyone around them.
  In conclusion, tackling hate speech requires a collective effort. Governments, corporations, and individuals all have a role to play.
  By working together, we can foster a safer and more respectful digital space. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
