  "Have you ever encountered a comment online so hurtful that it made you question the safety of digital spaces? Hate
  speech is a serious issue, and today, I will discuss ways to mitigate its effects. I will first address the root
  causes of hate speech, followed by an analysis of current mitigation strategies, and finally, I will propose an
  individual-level response to counteract it. A study by Peterson (2022) found that hate speech thrives in environments
  with minimal moderation. Just like a virus spreads in an unvaccinated population, hate speech flourishes when left unchecked.
  By holding users accountable and pushing for stronger regulations, we can curb this issue effectively. Thank you."
